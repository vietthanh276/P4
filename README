This program will use queues to model a coffeeshop with 1 or more check-out lines and
cashiers. Each customer will have 4 values associated with them: ID, arrival time, order start
time and completed time. At random intervals, customers will enter the store and join the queue.
As time goes on, customers will reach the front of the queue and make their purchase before
leaving the queue. 
To compile the program, run the command:
g++ -o run_simulation simulation.cpp shopQueue.cpp customer.h shopQueue.h
To run the program, run the command:
./run_simulation seed total_min arrive_prob order_prob queues outputFile
